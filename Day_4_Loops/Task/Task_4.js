//Task 4: Write a program to print numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop.

let i = 10; // Initialize counter variable i to 10

while (i >= 1) { // Condition: loop until i is greater than or equal to 1
    console.log(i); // Print the current value of i
    i--; // Decrement the counter variable i by 1
}
